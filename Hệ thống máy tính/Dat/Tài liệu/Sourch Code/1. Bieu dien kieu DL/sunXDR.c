/*
Security vulnerability in the XDR library
In 2002, it was discovered that code supplied by Sun Microsystems to implement the XDR library, a
widely used facility for sharing data structures between programs, had a security vulnerability arising
from the fact that multiplication can overflow without any notice being given to the program.
Code similar to that containing the vulnerability is shown below:

Illustration of code vulnerability similar to that found in Sunâ€™s XDR library.
