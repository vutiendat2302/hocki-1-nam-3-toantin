Story 4:
A man was travelling abroad in a small red car. One day he left the
car and went shopping. When he came back, its roof was badly
damaged. Some boys told him that an elephant had damaged it.
The man did not believe them, but they took him to a circus which
was near there. The owner of the elephant said, 'I am very sorry!
My elephant has a big, round, red chair. He thought that your car
was his chair, and he sat on it!' Then he gave the man a letter, in
which he said that he was sorry and that he would pay for all the
damage.
When the man got back to his own country, the customs officers
would not believe his story. They said, 'You sold your new car
while you were abroad and bought this old one!'
It was only when the man showed them the letter from the circus
man that they believed him.
